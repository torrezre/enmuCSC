## TL;DR:

| ----------- | ----------- |------ |
| 2/10, 5:30pm MT | TBD      | [here](https://meet.jit.si/moderated/c9ca68e060c8cf1380382e1a6d78bb08e44d2826c949e9eeb6d87b5e667ff4a2)

## Further Detail

Our first meeting this semester will be Friday the 10th at 5:30pm [at this link](https://meet.jit.si/moderated/c9ca68e060c8cf1380382e1a6d78bb08e44d2826c949e9eeb6d87b5e667ff4a2) for remote members. Physical location is not yet set, but will default to UCC 107. I'd like to find a room with a mic that can pick up in person members better, as that was a recurring issue last semester.

The agenda for the first meeting will be discussing the organization and our plans for this semester, so please feel free to brainstorm and speak up should you have a good idea.

Our current plans were to present workshops for basic computer literacy to the student body and general public.

After the meeting, this posting will be used to host the minutes, and all subsequent postings will do the same.
