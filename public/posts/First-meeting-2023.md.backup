## Further Detail

Our first meeting this semester will be Friday the 10th at 5:30pm.

Physical location is [Zuni](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Campus+Union+Building+(CUB)/@34.1755565,-103.348176,21z/data=!3m1!5s0x8702c62d6f16e4d7:0x1e54ca82888309f8!4m5!3m4!1s0x8702c62d6ef2128f:0xa42244ed5f68748d!8m2!3d34.1754092!4d-103.3480025) in the CUB building, downstairs. I'd like to find a room with a mic that can pick up in person members better, as that was a recurring issue last semester.

The agenda for the first meeting will be discussing the organization and our plans for this semester, so please feel free to brainstorm and speak up should you have a good idea.

Our current plans were to present workshops for basic computer literacy to the student body and general public.

After the meeting, this posting will be used to host the minutes, and all subsequent postings will do the same.

## Minutes

Hey everyone, here's the results of some polls we took in yesterday's meetings!

**1. We'll be moving to having fully virtual meetings.**

For the convenience of everyone, and since the majority of our members are remote, it's been decided that we'll just do virtual meetings.

We'll still be doing in person events as well, but those will be scheduled differently from meetings.

Since it's virtual only, the time can also change.

**2. We're going to have flexible times and dates on meetings based on what's acceptable for the most people**

You can take the survey more than once if you have more than one day or time that you'd be available.

The next meeting would be sometime in the first week of May.

## Some other stuff!

- We'll be helping the Blackwater Draw Museum set up their augmented reality sandbox. If any IRL members want to help out with that, get in touch, and we can work out a meeting time to go work on it, and probably livestream it for remote members. 

- Also in the first week of May is a student org fair, which I would like to attend. If you would like to help set up and run the booth, let me know!
