We'll be helping the Blackwater Draw Museum set up their augmented reality sandbox. At one point it worked, but now it doesn't. 

So, if on campus members wanted to work on it, please let me know and we can set up a date and time to meet up. These events can be livestreamed for our remote members, too!
