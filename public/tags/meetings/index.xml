      <description>TL;DR: When Where Link 2/10, 5:30pm MT Zuni room in CUB, downstairs here (closed) Further Detail Our first meeting this semester will be Friday the 10th at 5:30pm.
Physical location is Zuni in the CUB building, downstairs. I&amp;rsquo;d like to find a room with a mic that can pick up in person members better, as that was a recurring issue last semester.
The agenda for the first meeting will be discussing the organization and our plans for this semester, so please feel free to brainstorm and speak up should you have a good idea.</description>
