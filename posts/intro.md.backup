## TL;DR:

This site is for:

* Wider collaboration from outside the club
* Publicly viewable information for non-members to view
* Record of past projects, events, and meetings
* Ongoing project for members to participate directly with

## Further Detail

I'd like this website to be a platform and archive for club activities and a connection with the general public. I'd also like this to be a website that all members can contribute to, so it's [on github](https://github.com/torrezre/enmu-cs-club/tree/main/public). 

I'd also like a reference point for members to have as far as what's happening at the next meeting, what happened at a meeting they didn't go to, and what general projects are going on. And that's why I would like this to be something all members can access and post stuff to. 

But, it's not hidden in a discord server, it's something the general public can view. This can allow for non-members to contribute to a project if it appeals to them, even if the general club isn't as interesting.

## Technical Stuff

This was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The updates pushed to the repo are deployed automatically.

CS Club members who would like to contribute content may push updates directly. [Contact me](renata.torrez@enmu.edu) and I'll add you to the repo. Try not to break stuff, or at least, try to learn how to avoid breaking things while breaking things. But also don't worry *too* much, as github has version control for specifically this reason.

Members who aren't comfortable messing with the repo may send me a markdown file or just bare text.

## Even More Technical Stuff

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) following the guide for whatever OS being used
2. (Optional) Install git
	1. You can download it for version control and pushing / pulling to / from the repo,  but if that sounds like gobbledygook, you don't have to. Give it a try anyway, if you want. Could be fun.
3. Download the repo
4. In the terminal, cd to the site's root
5. Run 'hugo server' for a localhost development environment
6. Make whatever changes you want. You have a live example to eyeball.
7. Run 'hugo' to populate the public folder
8. Upload the public folder to the repo however you want.

Doesn't make sense? Sounds like something we could do a workshop on.

Does make sense? Cool!
